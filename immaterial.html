<p>From ancient myth to modern science fiction, reoccurring stories are the ones about men who build women. As the dream of a man-made life form and artificial intelligence are slowly starting to come true, these tales have become part of our reality.</p>

<p>Immaterial Girls is a digital publication about these artificial women. Itâ€™s a project about trying to understand their very existence, and an invitation to speculate about their future. Why do they look the way they do, why do they need a gender, and why does their appearance and behavior have to match ours? What do we, as humans, have to keep in mind when artificial intelligence may equal ours within a lifetime?</p>

<p>In a digital website-based publication and a collection of videos you are invited to see for yourself what has been, what is, and what will be for a soon-to-be-self-aware life form. By doing this, maybe we will learn something new about our own way of being.</p>
